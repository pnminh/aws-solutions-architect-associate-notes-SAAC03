# Auto Scaling Group

## TLDR
A Group of [[EC2]] Instances scaled horizontally, can use an [[ELB]] or work without it if there is no incomming traffic. Can use [[ELB]] or [[EC2]] health checks. Can also be used for [[ECS]] in which case it uses a ecs service as target.

## Features
- scale horizontaly
- scale out and in
- ensure maximum and minimum ec2s
- automaticly register EC2 with load balancer
- if instance is unhealthy it will be terminated and recreated
- set desired capacity

## Launch template
- similar to launch config
- specifies same stuff
- allows for multiple versions of a template
- can mix on demand and spot instances

## Launch configuration
- defines instace configuration (size etc)
- AMI
- instance Type
- key pair
- [[SecurityGroup]]
- block device mapping
- can not be modified but must be swaped if already in use

### [[EC2]] Tencacy
- dedicated before other configs
- Take [[VPC]] tenacy config into account

## Instance States

### Standby
- used for maintance
- wont be terminated if health check fails
- wont recieve traffic

## Termination Order
1. Cost (Spot vs on-demand)
2. oldest launch configuration
3. oldest launch template
4. closest to next billig hour

## Scaling Policies

### Simple
- scale by threshhold values
- must wait for scaling and health check to complete to scale again
- must wait for cooldown period expide to scale again

### Step
- scale by multiple threshold values to diffrent configs

### Scheduled
- scale on predefined time window

### Target Tracking
- scale to match the defined metric (e.g. 50% cpu)
- must not wait for cooldown period

## Scaling Actions

### Rebalancing
Happens when an instance is missing or AZ is changed or Spot schenanigans.
1. Launch new instances
2. Terminate old instances

### Scaling
Happens for health checks
1. Terminate
2. Launch new

## Standby vs detach
In summary, standby instances are temporarily removed from the Auto Scaling Group for maintenance or debugging, while detached instances are permanently removed and managed manually outside the group's control. 
## Predictive vs schedule scaling
- similar, except predictive uses machine learning to set up scheduled scaling

## Target tracking scaling vs simple scaling
Target Tracking Scaling: no waiting for cooldown period

Simplicity: Easier to set up and manage.
Automation: The Auto Scaling group adjusts capacity automatically based on the specified target metric.
Simple Scaling:

Flexibility: Allows more manual control over specific conditions and actions.
Configuration: Requires setting up CloudWatch alarms and defining scaling policies based on those alarms.
