# AWS Lambda

## TLDR
AWS Lambda means you dont care about any infrastructure, you just upload a function to aws. You can than use that function from other services like  [[APIGateway]], [[SNS]] or even [[CLI]]. You upload Lambda code as a zip.

## Features
- Run code serverless
- Pay per compute time
- Scaling is automated
- No charge if not running
- Operates from AWS owned[[VPC]]
- By default only public traffic
- You can enable function [[VPC]] access if you need private resources from your [[VPC]]
- Scale up based on request amount
- Can set custom function timeout
- Can be packaged and deployed as container images

## Drawbacks
- Limited by time SHORT EXECUTIONS
- if you need both private and public resources, you will have to enable [[VPC]] access and use a nat gateway to access the internet

## Security

### Lambda authorizer
- Send additonal info based of bearer token or request context
- Is useful because you can skip having to lookup users inside of your function (you pass the user data)
- Dont pass credentials! (Though you could)

## Compute Power
- Relative to memory allocation which can be manually set

## Lambda Layer
- Zip archive which contains librarties, custom runtime and other dependecies
- A single function can use up to 5 layers
- Can use self created layers or already published ones
- Unzipped size cannot exeed 250mb for a function and all layers which it depends on

## Container Image
- If using an image the image must implement the [[Lambda]] runtime api
- [[ECS]] and Fargate are prefered for this use case

## Price
- Pay per call first 1 mill are free
- 0.20 cent per one million request after
- Pay per duration 400000GB-Seconds per month free (1)
- Price scales up after that depending on gbseconds (more will be cheaper per gbsecond)

(1): GBs = amount of ram multiplied by execution time

## Limits Per Region
The default account limit for Lambda concurrency is up to 1000 executions per second, per region (can be increased). It is therefore most likely that the concurrency execution limit for the account was exceeded.
If exceed => 429 error
### Memory 
- 128MB to 10GB in 1mb increments

### Max Exec Time
- 900 seconds/ 15 mins

### ENV vars
- 4kb for all vars together

### Disk
- 512MB to 10GB

### Concurrency
- 1000 but can be increased

### Deployment

#### Zip Size
- 50 MB

#### Uncompressed With Dependencies
- 250 MB

#### TMP
- can use /tmp to load other files after/on startup

### Encryption
- Lmabda uses KMS key to encrypt envs by default, but the default key makes other see plaintext data
- Use helpers and custom KMS key to encrypt data instead
